                        <p> Pro skater Bob Burnquist knows a thing or two about building hard core skate ramps. For one
                            of
                            Visit California's #DreamBig​ locations, he and his design team construct a half pipe that
                            has
                            one purpose: float on the pristine waters of Lake Tahoe.</p>
